Entity(coulumn head) Relation Diagram

Relation between entities can be: 
    one to one 
    one to many
    many to many  

As a DB designer I can decided the relationships between the entities. 

#KEYS
Primary Keys - A unique code/number for a stored commodity in DB. 
Foreign Keys - Takes a Primary key and uses it another table as a Foreign key.

SUBQUERY - A query within a query. subqueries come into picture when
2 or more tables are present in a DB. 

eg.
SELECT "title" FROM "books" WHERE "publisher_id" = (
     SELECT "id" FROM "publishers" WHERE "publisher" = 'MacLehose Press');

SELECT ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "Average Rating"  FROM "ratings" WHERE "book_id" = (
     SELECT "id" FROM "books" WHERE "title" = 'In Memory of Memory');

Q. Which author has written the 'The Birthday Party'? 
A. SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
   WHERE "id" = (
     SELECT "author_id" FROM "authored"
     WHERE "book_id" = (
         SELECT "id" FROM "books"
         WHERE "title" = "The Birthday Party"
     )
);
