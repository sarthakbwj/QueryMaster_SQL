Entity(coulumn head) Relation Diagram

Relation between entities can be: 
    one to one 
    one to many
    many to many  

As a DB designer I can decided the relationships between the entities. 

#KEYS
Primary Keys - A unique code/number for a stored commodity in DB. 
Foreign Keys - Takes a Primary key and uses it another table as a Foreign key.
