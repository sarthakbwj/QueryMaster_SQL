Entity(coulumn head) Relation Diagram

Relation between entities can be: 
    one to one 
    one to many
    many to many  

As a DB designer I can decided the relationships between the entities. 

#KEYS
Primary Keys - A unique code/number for a stored commodity in DB. 
Foreign Keys - Takes a Primary key and uses it another table as a Foreign key.

SUBQUERY - A query within a query. subqueries come into picture when
2 or more tables are present in a DB. 

eg.
SELECT "title" FROM "books" WHERE "publisher_id" = (
     SELECT "id" FROM "publishers" WHERE "publisher" = 'MacLehose Press');

SELECT "rating" FROM "ratings" WHERE "book_id" = (
     SELECT "id" FROM "books" WHERE "title" = 'In Memory of Memory');

find all ratings for the books - 
In Memory of Memory
